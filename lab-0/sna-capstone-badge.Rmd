## SNA Capstone Badge

The culminating activity for SNA in STEM Ed is designed to provide you with some space for independent analysis. To earn your SNA Capstone Badge, you are required to demonstrate your ability to formulate a basic research question appropriate to a social network context, wrangle and analyze relational data, and. **Your primary goal for this analysis is to create a simple data product to illustrate key findings from a social network analysis** by applying the knowledge and skills acquired from the course readings and case studies from the SNA Learning Labs.

1.  **Identify a data source.** We highly encouraged you to use your own data or identify a new data source related to an area of professional interest. However, you are welcome to select datasets that we have created or curated for our learning labs, or those from the SNA and Education book described [here](https://studysites.sagepub.com/carolan/study/resources.htm).

2.  **Formulate a question.** I recommend keeping this simple and limiting to no more than one or two questions. Your question(s) should be appropriate to your data set and ideally be answered by applying concepts and skills from our course readings and case study. For example, you may be interested in determining whether gender predicts discussion forum replies among using the MOOC-Ed dataset created by Kellogg & Edelmann.

3.  **Analyze the data.** I highly recommend creating a new R script for your analysis to use as you work through data wrangling and analysis. Your R script will likely contain code that doesn't make it into your R Markdown presentation or report since you will likely experiment with different approaches and figure out code that works and code that does not.

4.  **Create a data product.** When you feel you've wrangled and analyzed the data to your satisfaction, create an R Markdown file that includes a polished sociogram and/or data table and a narrative highlighting your research question, data source, and key findings and potential implications. Your R Markdown file should include a polished sociogram and/or table, a title and narrative, and all code necessary to read, wrangle, and explore your data.

5.  **Share your findings.** Knit your data product to a desired output format. This may be a simple [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html), [PDF](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html), or [MS Word](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/word-document.html) file; or something more complex like [HTML5 slides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html), a [Tufte-style handout](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-handouts.html), [dashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), or [website](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html). Then create a new discussion post below to share your analysis. Include in the post your published web link (e.g., via [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/about/getting-started) or [GitHub](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-free-github-pages-website-53743d7524e1)) or attached file (e.g. HTML or PDF) and add a short reflection including one thing you learned and one thing you'd like to explore further.
