.panel[.panel-name[Relationships]
Social network analysis is motivated by a **relational** intuition based on ties connecting social actors:

- no individual is an island, do NOT assume independence
- who we know, are friends with, or talks with matters
- the influence of these relations is shaped by the larger network
- location in a social structure shapes one's opportunities and outcomes

It is firmly grounded in **systematic empirical data collection** using methods refined over decades and methods still evolving:

- digital learning tools and social media

# Discussion
Consider a social network of which you are a part. 
1. Who are the network's actors? 

1. What ties connect these actors? 

1. Are there any groups within this network? 

1. What relations within this network might be of interest to a researcher?
