The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data (ideally your own) and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research. To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts in Part I designed to help assess your understanding of key concepts and to help you think about potential next steps for your own study. In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Comprehension Check

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies social network analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate an network study that makes use of statistical models to explain or predict an education related process or outcome.** You are also welcome to select one of the research papers listed in the in our [essential readings](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/tree/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-4) that may have peaked your interest. :

1.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to address and why did they consider these questions important?

    -   

2.  What statistical models were employed in this study to address these research questions?

    -   

3.  What were the results of these analyses?

    -   

Think about a network that you are a part of, or may be interested in studying, and answer the following questions:

4.  What is a research question that you might ask about this network that a statistical model for networks (e.g. QAP, P\*, etc.) might help to address?

    -   

5.  What model would be most appropriate for addressing this question and why?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

In our SNA Lab 4 Case Study, we only scratched the surface on the number of network and node attributes properties that can be tested using ERGMs. Take a look at a [table of common ergm-terms](http://statnet.org/nme/d2-ergmterms.html) or type "ergm-terms" into the help menu of the files pane for some additional examples.

Using one of the data sets provided for our case study, or your own data set if you're feeling really ambitious, **your goal for this lab is to extend the ERGM analysis from our case study by adding a new parameter/term to our model.** For example, you may be interested in examining shared characteristics among school leaders might help explain tie formation, such as gender, level of trust in colleagues, or whether they work at the school or district level.

I highly recommend creating a new R script in your `lab-4` folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share the final code for your model and answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE


```

1.  What were the results of your new model?

    -   

2.  How would you frame a research question that this model helps address?

    -   

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Models & Inference Badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by

1.  Click the yarn icon above to knit your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.
2.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.
3.  Locate and copy the link to your to your GitHub web page ([See here for instructions](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-free-github-pages-website-53743d7524e1)).
4.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our SNA Badges discussion forum. In your post, include the link to your published web page and a short reflection including one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
