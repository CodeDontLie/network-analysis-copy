# Top Down Methods

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Overview]

The “top-down” approach focuses on how larger network structures are built from smaller ones. Or stated more clearly:

&gt; ...this approach takes the complete network and considers parts of it that are dense and somewhat distinct from the rest of the network.

.panel[.panel-name[Components]

.pull-left[
A **component** is a connected subgraph in which there is a path between all pairs of nodes.

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]
Consider a network you are interested in studying and think about the following questions: 

- Who are the network's actors? 

- What ties connect these actors? 

- Are there any groups within this network? 

- What research questions are you interested in investigating?

# Network Data Structures

.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[Node-List]

.pull-left[

Consistent with typical data storage, node-lists often include:
- Identifiers lik name or **ID**
- Demographic info (**gender**, age) 
- Socio-economic info (job, income)
- Substantive info (**grades**, attendance)

]


.pull-right[


| id|gender |achievement |
|--:|:------|:-----------|
|  1|female |high        |
|  2|male   |average     |
|  3|female |average     |
|  4|male   |high        |
|  5|female |average     |
|  6|female |average     |

]


]

.panel[.panel-name[Edge-List]

.pull-left[

Radically different than typical data storage, edge-lists include:
- **ego and an alter**
- tie strength or frequency
- edge attributes (time, event, text)

]


.pull-right[


| from| to| weight|
|----:|--:|------:|
|    1|  2|      1|

|    1|  8|      1|

]


]


.panel[.panel-name[Adjacency Matrix]

.pull-left[

Also radically different, an adjacency matrix includes:
- Column for each actor
- Row for each actor
- A Value indicate the presence/strength of a relation

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Take a look at one of the network datasets [here](https://github.com/laser-institute/network-analysis/tree/main/lab-1/data) and consider the following:

- What format is this data set stored as? 

- If edge data, is it directed or undirected? Valued?

- If node data, does the file contain attribute data? 

- What are some things you notice about this dataset? 

- What questions do you have about this dataset?

# Guiding Study

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Context]

Revisiting early work in the field of sociometry, this study ***assesses the level of agreement between teacher perceptions and student reports of classroom friendships*** among middle school students. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[Questions]

The central question guiding this investigation was:

&gt;***Do student reports agree with teacher perceptions*** when it comes to classroom friendship ties and with what consequences for commonly used social network measures?
]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]
- 1 teacher, 1 middle school, four classrooms
- Students  given roster and asked to evaluate relationships with peers
- Choices included best friend, friend, know-like, know, know-dislike, strongly dislike, and do not know.
- Relations are ***valued*** (degrees of friendship, not just yes or no)
- Data are ***directed*** (friendship nominations were not presumed to be reciprocal). 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Key Findings]

- Teacher’s perceptions and students’ reports were statistically similar, 11–29% of possible ties did not match.
- Students reported significantly more reciprocated friendship ties than the teacher perceived.
- Observed level of agreement varied across classes and generally increased over time. 
]

]

Network Packages, Objects, and Sociograms

# Import Data

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Load Libraries]

Let's start by creating a new R script and loading the {tidyverse}, as well as the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} SNA packages introduced in Lab 1:          


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```

**Note:** You may have to install this package using the `install.packages()` function if it is not listed in your packages pane.  
]

.panel[.panel-name[Import Data]

Run the following code to use the `read_csv()` function from the {readr} package to read the `ccss-tweets-fresh.csv` file from the data folder and assign to a new data frame named ccss_tweets:


```r
ccss_ties &lt;- read_csv("data/ccss-edgelist.csv")

ccss_nodes &lt;- read_csv("data/ccss-nodelist.csv")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Inspect Data]

Now let's take a look at the data file we just imported using the `View()` function or another function of choice you may have learned in the Foundations Labs:


```r
View(ccss_ties)

View(ccss_nodes)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below and be prepared to share your response:              
1. What do you think the rows and columns in each file represent? 

1. What about the values in each cell represent?

1. What else do you notice about the data? 

1. What questions do you have? 

]

# Tidy Graph  

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[tbl_graph( ) function]

The [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) function creates a special network data structure called a "tidy graph" that combines our nodes and edges into a single R object. Run the following code in your R script:


```r
ccss_network &lt;- tbl_graph(edges = ccss_ties,
                          nodes = ccss_nodes, 
                          directed = TRUE) 
```
The benefits of a "tidy graph" is that opens up the entire suite of tidyverse tools for manipulating and constructing network data and variables noted earlier. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[View Network]


Using your R script, type the name of network object we just created and run the code to produce the output on the next tab:


```r
# ADD CODE BELOW
#
#
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[View Sociogram]



```r
ggraph(ccss_network, layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .1) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size())) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = actors,
                     size = local_size()),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph()
```

```
## Warning: ggrepel: 1 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider
## increasing max.overlaps
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below:              

1. What is size of our CSSS twitter network?

1. Does our network contain any obvious groups?

1. What insights have gained about out network so far?

1. What questions do have about have about out network so far?

# Components

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

One of the most basic ways researchers can characterize a network's substructure is to identify its components.

&gt; A **component** is a connected subgraph in which there is a path between all pairs of nodes.

Recall from our output above that our directed "multigraph" had 13 components. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Quick Look]

A weak component, as illustrated by the graph generated by the code below, ignores the direction of a tie; 


```r
autograph(ccss_network)
```

Strong components do not. In other words:

&gt; **Strong components** consist of nodes that are connected to one another via both directions along the path that connects them.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Implementation]
The {igraph} package has a simple `components()` function for identifying the number of components in a network, the size of each component, and which actors belong to each.


```r
components(ccss_network, mode = c("strong"))
```

How many "strong" components are in our network?
]



]


---
# Cliques

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

Examining cliques is one bottom-up approach that reveals how groups are distributed in the network and which actors belong to which groups.

&gt; A clique is a maximally connected subgraph of nodes (&gt; 2) in which all nodes are connected to each other. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[Clique Number]

Similar to our component analysis, the {igraph} function has a super simple `clique_num()` function for identifying number of completely connected subgroups in a network:


```r
clique_num(ccss_network)
```

As you probably saw above, the `clique_num()` function does not take into account directionality of our ties. It looks like we have 3 clusters of at least 3 actors that all have ties to one another.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Implementation]
The {igraph} function also has a simple `cliques()` function for
identifying members who belong to the same group.

Let's see if there are any cliques that contain a minimum of 4 nodes?


```
## Warning in cliques(ccss_network, min = 4, max = NULL): At core/cliques/
## cliquer_wrapper.c:57 : Edge directions are ignored for clique calculations.
```

]



]

# Key Actors

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Degree]

As we learned in our previous lab, a key structural
property of networks is the concept of centralization. 

One of the most common descriptives reported in network studies and a
primary measure of centralization is degree.

&gt; **Degree** is the number of ties to and from an ego. In a directed
&gt; network, in-degree is the number of ties received, whereas out-degree
&gt; is the number of ties sent.


]

.panel[.panel-name[Activate Nodes]

The {tidygraph} package has an aptly named function
`centrality_degree()` for calculating degree, in-degree, and out-degree
for all actors in a network. 

To use it, we'll need to `activate()` our `nodes` and create a new node-level variable using `mutate()` from the {dplyr}


```r
ccss_network &lt;- ccss_network |&gt;
  activate(nodes) |&gt;
  mutate(in_degree = centrality_degree(mode = "in"),
         out_degree = centrality_degree(mode = "out"))
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[View Network]
Let's take a look at our network now. 


```r
ccss_network
```

```
## # A tbl_graph: 92 nodes and 289 edges
## #
## # A directed multigraph with 13 components

.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]
