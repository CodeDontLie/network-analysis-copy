        "#### Abstract\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers of social networks commonly distinguish between \"behavioral\" and \"cognitive\" social structure. In a school context, for example, a teacher's perceptions of student friendship ties, not necessarily actual friendship relations, may influence teacher behavior. Revisiting early work in the field of sociometry, this study assesses the level of agreement between teacher perceptions and student reports of within-classroom friendship ties. Using data from one middle school teacher and four classes of students, the study explores new ground by assessing agreement over time and across classroom social contexts, with the teacher-perceiver held constant. While the teacher's perceptions and students' reports were statistically similar, 11--29% of possible ties did not match. In particular, students reported significantly more reciprocated friendship ties than the teacher perceived. Interestingly, the observed level of agreement varied across classes and generally increased over time. This study further demonstrates that significant error can be introduced by conflating teacher perceptions and student reports. Findings reinforce the importance of treating behavioral and cognitive classroom friendship networks as distinct, and analyzing social structure data that are carefully aligned with the social process hypothesized.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Research Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "The central question guiding this investigation was:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Do student reports agree with teacher perceptions when it comes to classroom friendship ties and with what consequences for commonly used social network measures?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be using this question to guide our own analysis of the classroom friendships reported by teachers. Specifically, we will use the first part of this question to guide our analysis and develop two sociograms to help visually compare similarities and differences between teacher and student reported classroom friendships.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Collection\n",
        "\n",
        "To measure the level of agreement between student and teacher reports of classroom student friendships, sociometric data were collected from each student in all four classes and the teacher provided similar reports on all students. To collect student reports of friendships, students were given a class roster and asked to describe their relationship with each student in the class. Choices included best friend, friend, know-like, know, know-dislike, strongly dislike, and do not know. In the terminology of network analysis, these sociometric data are \"valued\" (degrees of friendship, not just yes or no) and \"directed\" (friendship nominations were not presumed to be reciprocal). Data were collected in the autumn and spring. All \"best friend\" and \"friend\" choices are coded as '1' (friend), while all other choices are coded as '0' (not friend). The teacher's reports of students' friendships were generated in a similar manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Analyses\n",
        "\n",
        "To assess agreement between perceived friendship by the teacher and students, QAP (quadratic assignment procedure) correlations for each class's two matrices (teacher and student generated) were analyzed in the autumn and spring. A QAP correlation is used to calculate the degree of association between two sets of relations; it tests whether the probability of dyad overlap in the teacher matrix is correlated with the probability of dyad overlap in the student matrix. It does so by running a large number of simulations. These simulations generate random matrices with sizes and value distributions based on the original two matrices being tested. It then computes an average level of correlation between the matrices that would be expected at random. Similarly, it calculates the probability that the observed degree of correlation between two matrices would be as large or as small as that observed based on the range of correlations generated in the random permutations, with an associated significance statistic.\n",

        "As highlighted in¬†[Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html), the¬†**Model**¬†step of the data science process entails \"using statistical models, from simple to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data.\" We will not explore the use of models for SNA until Module 4, but recall from the PREPARE section that to assess agreement between perceived friendships by the teacher and students, [@pittinsky2008behavioral] note that:\n",

        "> **The QAP (quadratic assignment procedure)** \\[is\\] used to calculate the degree of association between two sets of relations and tests whether the probability of dyad overlap in the teacher matrix is correlated with the probability of dyad overlap in the student matrix. It does so by running a large number of simulations. These simulations generate random matrices with sizes and value distributions based on the original two matrices being tested.\n",

        "\n",
        "The final step in the workflow/process is sharing the results of your analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al. @krumm2018 have outlined the following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders findings from an analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Select.** Communicating what one has learned involves selecting among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form, i.e.¬†a \"data product.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products, research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Narrate.** Writing a narrative to accompany the data products involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related research question, describing how best to interpret the data product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question and might be used to inform new analyses or a \"change idea\" for improving student learning.\n",

        "### Render File\n",
        "\n",
        "For your SNA Badge, you will have an opportunity to create a simple \"data product\" designed to illustrate some insights gained from your analysis and ideally highlight an action step or change idea that can be used to improve learning or the contexts in which learning occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we will wrap up this case study by converting your work to an HTML file that can be published and used to communicate your learning and demonstrate some of your new R skills. To do so, you will need to \"render\" your document by clicking the ![](img/render.png){width=\"4%\"} Render button in the menu bar at that the top of this file.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2.  creates a file in your directory that you can use to share you work .\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you've finished your first case study, click the \"Render\" button in the toolbar at the top of your document to covert this Quarto document to a HTML web page, just one of [the many publishing formats you can create with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html) documents.\n",
        "\n",

Finally, contact your instructor to debug the code together if you're still having issues.\n",
