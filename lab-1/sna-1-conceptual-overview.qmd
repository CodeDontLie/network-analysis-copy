> From its earliest origins to it most recent applications to large-scale networks, social network analysis has reflected an *interdependency between theory and method*.

~\~ From SNA and Education by Bryan @carolan2014~

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

Brian Carolan's book SNA and Education is a major inspiration for these SNA modules and is featured prominently in our essential readings and conceptual overviews. I highly recommend purchasing this book or obtaining a copy from the library at your local institution.

This quote is from Chapter 2 and highlights three components of SNA we'll be exploring in these modules, namely: methods used in network analysis, connections with sociological theory, and the applications of both in educational context.

SNA is unique among the learning analytics methods covered by the LASER Institute in that it is a set of analytical techniques for analyzing the structure of social relationships that is also tightly integrated with sociological theory.

# The 4 Hallmarks of SNA

Strucuralism, Empirical Data, Graphical Imagery, & Mathematically-Based

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

This first section introduces what Carolan describes as the four defining freatures of social network analysis, namely: a unique emphasis on **structuralism** based on ties among actors, a firm grounding in **empirical data**, it's use of **graphical imagery** and a new set of **mathematical models** and descriptive measures.
:::

## Relationships

SNA emphasizes structuralism based on **ties** connecting social **actors** and is motivated by our intuition that relationships matter:

-   no individual is an island, independence is NOT assumed
-   who we know, are friends with, or talk with matters
-   the influence of these relations is shaped by the larger network
-   location in a social structure shapes one's opportunities and outcomes

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

Here's a concrete example of the distinction between SNA and traditional research. Imagine studying a topic such as teacher effectiveness as measured by student test scores. In trying to undestand why some teachers are more "effective" than others, researchers tend to focus on the attributes of the teacher, for example their highest degree, use of technology, years of experience, or pathways toward licensesure and certification. However, they typically neglect the relations among teachers and between teachers and students and how these relations shape their effectiveness as a teacher. SNA attempts to account for the web of relations in which actors are embedded, this **social structure**, that simultaneously may constrain or provide opportunities for their effectiveness.
:::

## Empirical Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
SNA is firmly grounded in **systematic, empirical data collection** using methods refined over decades and still evolving, such as:

-   observations of social context
-   surveys and questionnaires
-   historical and administrative records
-   digital learning tools and social media

**Speaker Notes:**

The image on the right is from a publication by LASER Institute PI Dr. Shaun Kellogg and details the processes of constructing an online communication network dataset from discussion forums in a Massively Online Open Course for Educators (MOOC-Ed) called *The* *Digital* *Learning* *Transition in* *K-12* *Schools*.

Access to social relations through online learning tools and social media platforms has helped to spark a renewed interest in SNA over the past two decades and has resulted in the exponential growth of publications featuring SNA.

## Graphical Imagery

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
SNA makes freuqent use of **graphical imagery** to represent actors and their relations with one another.

The **sociogram** to the right includes:

-   Shapes for actors (nodes, vertices)
-   Lines for relations (ties, edges)

What do you think the lines and shapes depict in this 2nd grade classroom?

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

This image is an early example of a sociogram (i.e. a network graph) from a book published in 1934 grimly titled: **Who Shall Survive: A New Approach to the Problem of Human Interrelations.** It's also an excellent example of the educational roots of SNA research. This foundational work in the field of SNA is also freely available through the Internet Archive and linked in the references slide at the end of this presentation.

Answer to the question:

-   A circle represents a girl.

-   A triangle represents a boy.

-   The red line represents attraction, i.e. who they like in the class.

## Mathematically-Based

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Network Stats (Describe)**

-   Size
-   Centrality
-   Reciprocity
-   Density
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Network Models (Test & Predict)**

-   CONCOR

-   QAP

-   ERGMS

-   Regression
:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

SNA like other research methods relies on the use of mathematical and/or computational models to succinctly represent the complexity of social relationships.

Descriptive measures such as size, centrality, reciprocity, and density are used to describe characteristics of individuals or groups in a network and the network as a whole. We'll explore these measures in Module 2.

SNA also has a wide range of statistical models tailored to working with relational data for hypothesis testing and building predictive models, which we'll explore Module 3.

# Key Terms

Actors, Ties, and Attributes

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

In this section we introduce some very basic terms that are essential for being able to conceptualize and discuss social networks. These terms encompass those are a part of a social network (actors), relationships between them (ties), and information about both (attributes).
:::

## Actors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Also called **nodes** or **vertices**, actors can represent a range of social entities, like:

-   students in a classroom

-   teachers in a school district

-   parents in a community

-   school districts in a state

-   departments within a college
:::

:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

The important thing to note on this slide is that actors in social networks as represented by points or shapes on a graph don't necessarily have to represent single individuals, but can also represent collections of individuals, i.e. social entities.

This image is actual data that we'll be working with in this module. It comes from a study by Pittinsky and Carolan that examined the extent to which teachers' perceptions of student friendship networks agreed with those of their students and the implications for both researchers and practitioners.
:::

## Ties

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Also called **relations, edges**, or **links,** ties connect actors to one another and might consist of:

-   a behavioral interaction

-   a physical connection

-   an association or affiliation

-   an evaluation of one person by another

-   formal relations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![The teacher's perception of student friendships as illustrated by lines (friendships) connecting dots (students). ](img/ties.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

Note that in the graph, these lines simply indicate whether a friendship does or does not exist according to the teacher. However, these links can also also capture the degree of relationship (e.g., friend, best friend) as well as the direction of a relationship, which would be indicated by arrows indicating who reported being friends with who.

\[Use the Notes Canvas in the Slide Tools or a handy nearby whiteboard to draw arrows on explain the difference between line with and without arrows\]
:::

## Attributes

::: columns
Finally, actors, ties, and the network as a whole may also contain information, which may be incorporated into visualizations or network models:

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Individual** attributes based on properties of individual actors (e.g., gender, academic achievement)

-   **Relational** attributes based on an actor's direct ties with others (e.g., degree, reciprocity, or tie strength)

-   **Structural** attributes based on the entire network of connections actors ties with others (e.g., density, centralization, or reciprocity)

# Applications of SNA

Social Capital, Selection & Influence, Network Diffusion

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**
:::

## Social Capital

Social capital is an intangible asset existing in the connections and shared values that people have. SNA provides a means to actually measure & model social capital and has be used to better understand:

-   how social relations advantages some students [@maroulis2008does]

-   dropout among Latino/a/ex students [@ream2008student]

-   school-oriented friendship networks have the potential to reduce dropout rates

-   parental social closure and student math achievement (Morgan and Todd, 2008)

**Speaker Notes**

[Social Capital]{.underline}: An intangible asset existing in the connections and shared values that people have. SNA provides a means to actually measure & model social capital and has be used to better understand:

-   how social relations advantages some students (Maroulis and Gomez, 2008)
-   dropout among Latino/a/ex students (Ream and Rumberger, 2008)
-   school-oriented friendship networks have the potential to reduce dropout rates
-   parental social closure and student math achievement (Morgan and Todd, 2008)

[Selection & Influence]{.underline}: Why people are selected or connect with others and how these connections shape opportunities and outcomes for these individuals. Educational researchers have used modeling of peer selection and influence to better understand:

-   who school leaders collaborate and confide in and why (Daly and Finnigan, 2010)
-   how the characteristics of friends shape students' aspirations and college attendance (Hallinan & Williams, 1990)
-   teachers' attitudes toward school and district reforms (Cole & Weinbaum, 2010)
-   how friend influence and peer exposure widen the STEM gender gap (Raabe et al., 2019)
-   development of peer networks and academic performance (Brouwer et al, 2022)

[Diffusion]{.underline}: Building on theories of diffusion, SNA has been used to explain how ideas and resources spread within and between networks of actors, such as:

-   attitudes and use of computers in classrooms over time (Frank et al., 2011)
-   how substance abuse diffuses across adolescent networks (Valente et al., 2004)
-   diffusion of charter school policy and creation across states (Renzulli and Roscigno, 2005)

## Think, Draw & Discuss

Consider a small network you are a part of (\~ 5-10 individuals), or may be interested in studying, and think about the following questions:

1.  *Who are the actors in this networks?*
2.  *What types of ties might connect these actors?*

Now draw your network and think about the following questions:

1.  *How might someone's position in this network advantage or disadvantage these individuals?*
2.  *What personal attributes might be pertinent to capture for this network?*
