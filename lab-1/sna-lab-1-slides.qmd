## SNA: Method & Theory

"From its earliest origins to it most recent applications to large-scale networks, social network analysis has reflected an [**interdependency between theory and method**]{.underline}."

-Brian Carolan, Social Network Analysis and Education

::: notes
Social Network Analysis is unique among the learning analytics methods covered by the LASER Institute in that it is a set of analytical techniques for analyzing the structure of social relationships that are tightly integrated with sociological theory.

::: notes
**Structuralism**: Relationships Social network analysis is based on **ties** connecting social **actors** and is motivated by our intuition that relationships between individuals matter:

-   no individual is an island, independence is NOT assumed
-   who we know, are friends with, or talk with matters
-   the influence of these relations is shaped by the larger network
-   location in a social structure shapes one's opportunities and outcomes

**Empirical Data**: It is firmly grounded in \*\*systematic empirical data collection\*\* using methods refined over decades and methods still evolving:

-   observations of social context
-   surveys and questionnaires
-   historical and administrative records
-   digital learning tools and social media
