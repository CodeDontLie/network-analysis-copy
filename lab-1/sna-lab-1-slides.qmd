## SNA: Method & Theory

> From its earliest origins to it most recent applications to large-scale networks, social network analysis has reflected an **interdependency between theory and method**.

Brian Carolan, Social Network Analysis and Education

::: notes
Social Network Analysis is unique among the learning analytics methods covered by the LASER Institute in that it is a set of analytical techniques for analyzing the structure of social relationships that are tightly integrated with sociological theory.

## The Four Hallmarks of SNA

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
1.  Emphasis on **structuralism** based on ties among actors
2.  Firmly grounded in **empirical data**
3.  use of **graphical imagery** and data visualization
4.  **math**ematically based [@freeman2004development]

**Speaker Notes**

1.  **Structuralism**: Relationships Social network analysis is based on **ties** connecting social **actors** and is motivated by our intuition that relationships between individuals matter:
    -   no individual is an island, independence is NOT assumed
    -   who we know, are friends with, or talk with matters
    -   the influence of these relations is shaped by the larger network
    -   location in a social structure shapes one's opportunities and outcomes
2.  **Empirical Data**: It is firmly grounded in **systematic empirical data collection** using methods refined over decades and methods still evolving:
    -   observations of social context
    -   surveys and questionnaires
    -   historical and administrative records
    -   digital learning tools and social media
3.  It makes use of **graphic imagery** to represent actors and their relations with one another.
    -   Shapes for actors (nodes, vertices)
    -   Lines for relations (ties, edges)
4.  **Mathematics**: It relies on the use of **mathematical and/or computational models** to succinctly represent the complexity of social life:
    -   [Network Stats]{.underline}
        -   Centrality
        -   Reciprocity
        -   Density
    -   [Inferential Models]{.underline}
        -   CONCOR
        -   QAP
        -   ERGMS

## Key Terms

::: panel-tabset
## Actors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Also called **nodes** or **vertices**, actors can represent a range of social entities, like:

-   students in a classroom

-   teachers in a school district

-   school districts in a state

-   departments within a college

-   parents in a community

## Ties

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Also called **relations** or **edges**, ties connect actors to one another and may consist of:

-   a behavioral interaction

-   a physical connection

-   an association or affiliation

-   an evaluation of one person by another

-   formal relations

## Attributes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  **Personal** data based on properties of individual actors (e.g., gender, achievement)

2.  **Relational** data based on an actor's direct ties with others (e.g., degree or connectedness)

3.  **Structural** data based on the entire network of connections actors ties with others (e.g., centrality)

**Speaker Notes**

***Actors***, also called nodes or vertices, can be a range of social entities, like:

-   students in a classroom
-   teachers in a school district
-   school districts in a state
-   departments within a college
-   parents in a community

***Ties***, also called relations or edges, connect actors to one another, like:

-   behavioral interaction
-   physical connection
-   association or affiliation
-   evaluation of one person by another
-   formal relations
-   moving between places or status

***Attributes***, information about actors and sometimes ties:

-   [Personal]{.underline} data based on properties of individual actors (e.g., gender, achievement)

-   [Relational]{.underline} data based on an actor's direct ties with others (e.g., degree or connectedness)

-   [Structural]{.underline} data based on the entire network of connections actors ties with others (e.g., centrality)

## Applications in SNA

::: panel-tabset
## Social Capital

Social capital is an intangible asset existing in the connections and shared values that people have. SNA provides a means to actually measure & model social capital and has be used to better understand:

-   how social relations advantages some students (Maroulis and Gomez, 2008)

-   dropout among Latino/a/ex students (Ream and Rumberger, 2008)

-   school-oriented friendship networks have the potential to reduce dropout rates

-   parental social closure and student math achievement (Morgan and Todd, 2008)

## Selection & Influence

## Diffusion
:::

## Applications in SNA

Interest in SNA has grown tremendously in the past few decades for studying educational contexts and social phenomena in such as:

-   Diffusion and adoption of innovations

-   Social selection & influence

-   Social capital

-   Policy and program evaluation

**Speaker Notes**

[Social Capital]{.underline}: An intangible asset existing in the connections and shared values that people have. SNA provides a means to actually measure & model social capital and has be used to better understand:

-   how social relations advantages some students (Maroulis and Gomez, 2008)
-   dropout among Latino/a/ex students (Ream and Rumberger, 2008)
-   school-oriented friendship networks have the potential to reduce dropout rates
-   parental social closure and student math achievement (Morgan and Todd, 2008)

[Selection & Influence]{.underline}: Why people are selected or connect with others and how these connections shape opportunities and outcomes for these individuals. Educational researchers have used modeling of peer selection and influence to better understand:

-   who school leaders collaborate and confide in and why (Daly and Finnigan, 2010)
-   how the characteristics of friends shape students' aspirations and college attendance (Hallinan & Williams, 1990)
-   teachers' attitudes toward school and district reforms (Cole & Weinbaum, 2010)
-   how friend influence and peer exposure widen the STEM gender gap (Raabe et al., 2019)
-   development of peer networks and academic performance (Brouwer et al, 2022)

[Diffusion]{.underline}: Building on theories of diffusion, SNA has been used to explain how ideas and resources spread within and between networks of actors, such as:

-   attitudes and use of computers in classrooms over time (Frank et al., 2011)
-   how substance abuse diffuses across adolescent networks (Valente et al., 2004)
-   diffusion of charter school policy and creation across states (Renzulli and Roscigno, 2005)

## Think, Draw & Discuss

Consider a small network you are a part of (\~ 5-10 individuals), or may be interested in studying, and think about the following questions:

1.  *Who are the actors in this networks?*
2.  *What types of ties might connect these actors?*

Now draw your network and think about the following questions:

1.  *How might someone's position in this network advantage or disadvantage these individuals?*
2.  *What personal attributes might be pertinent to capture for this network?*
