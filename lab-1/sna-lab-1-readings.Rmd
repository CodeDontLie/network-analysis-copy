## Overview

The primary goal of our essential readings in Lab 1 is to build a basic
understanding of social network analysis (SNA) as an approach to
understand and improve learning processes and outcomes. The required and
self-selected readings provide an introduction to SNA in the field of
education, including the historical, theoretical, and analytical
foundations of a social network perspective. A secondary goal of rthe
eadings and reflection questions is to help you start generating ideas
for independent application of network analysis.

## Readings

For Lab 1 you will read chapters 1 and 2 from [Social Network Analysis
and Education](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU2803782)
[@carolan2014] and locate one additional research article, presentation,
or informal study to help address our discussion questions for the week.

### SNA and Education Part I: Theory and Concepts

The following readings for this lab illustrate how social network
analysis provides educational researchers with a different way of
thinking about and measuring an learning processes and outcomes by that
explicitly account for the importance of one's relationships with
others, as well as the larger pattern in which these relationships are
embedded.

### Self-Selected Study

Use your institutional library (e.g., [NCSU
Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a
research or practitioner-focused article, presentation, or resource that
applies social network analysis to an educational context or topic of
interest. More specifically, **locate an network study that makes use of
network visualization, including a sociogram, to describe an educational
context.** You are also welcome to select one of the research papers
cited in our essential readings that may have piqued your interest. Your
selection should address one or more of the discussion topics/questions
(see below) and you're welcome to identify SNA resources outside of the
field of education.

## Reflection

To help guide your reflection on the readings, a set of guiding
questions are provided below. After you have had a chance to work
through one or more of the readings, **we encourage you to contribute to
our learning community by creating a new post to our [Social Network
Analysis
Team](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis) on
GitHub**. You post might contain a response to one or more of the
guiding questions, questions you still have about the topics addressed,
or insights gained into your own research.

### Chapter 1: The Social Network Perspective and Educational Research Introduction

1.  Consider a network of which you are a part. Who are the network's
    actors? What ties connect these actors? Are there any groups within
    this network? What relations within this network might be of
    interest to a researcher? Finally, what makes this collection of
    actors a social network?

2.  Using the same question from the previous response, explain the
    analytical level at which these data would need to be collected and
    analyzed.

### Chapter 2: Historical, Theoretical, and Analytical Foundations

Draft a research question for a population you may be interested in
studying, or that would be of interest to educational researchers, and
that would require the collection of relational data. Next, think about
the following questions:

1.  What relational data would need to be collected? 

2.  For what reason would relational data need to be collected in order
    to address this question?

3.  Explain the analytical level at which these data would need to be
    collected and analyzed.

4.  How does this differ from the ways in which individual or group
    behavior is typically conceptualized and modeled in conventional
    educational research?

### Chapter 3: Basic Concepts

Refer to the graph in you self-selected study and answer the following
questions:

1.  Is this graph directed or undirected? Are the lines arcs or edges?
    Given your responses to these questions, what type of relation might
    this graph represent?

2.  Based on what you see in this graph, is this relation valued or
    binary?

3.  What attribute data might you want to incorporate into analysis?

#### Bonus Questions:

Create a matrix that represents the relational data evident in the graph
and answer the following questions:

1.  How many actors are in this matrix?

2.  How many rows and columns are in this matrix?

3.  What type of data are in the cells of this matrix?

4.  Is this matrix symmetric? Explain the values on the diagonal of the
    matrix.
