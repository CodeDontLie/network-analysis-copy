Recall that the key difference between data used in typical STEM Ed Research and data used for social network analysis is the focus on relationships between individual rather than the individual themselves. As a result, this presents some unique issues inherent in how we manage of social network data, as well as the measurements derived from this data. 

This workshop is divided into two parts. In Part I, we focus on data management, including how to collect and store network data, as well as approaches to help ensure the quality of the data we collect. In Part II, we take a quick look at a study by Alan Daly that illustrates some of these approaches, and will then learn about some basic network-level measures such as dessity, centrality, and reciprocity that are commonly used to describe our networks mathematically.

# A Quick Refresher

### The four hallmarks of social network analysis: 
1. an emphasis on structuralism based on ties among actors;
2. firmly grounded in empirical data; 
3. the use of graphical imagery; 
4. is mathematically based.

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]
Consider a network you are interested in studying and think about the following questions: 

- Who are the network's actors? 

- What ties connect these actors? 

- Are there any groups within this network? 

- What research questions are you interested in investigating?

# Data Storage

.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[Node-List]

.pull-left[

Consistent with typical data storage, node-lists often include:
- Identifiers lik name or **ID**
- Demographic info (**gender**, age) 
- Socio-economic info (job, income)
- Substantive info (**grades**, attendance)

]


.pull-right[

```{r node-list, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
student_attributes <- read_excel("data/student-attributes.xlsx")

student_attributes |>
  head() |>
  select(id, gender, achievement) |>
  kable()
```

]


]

.panel[.panel-name[Edge-List]

.pull-left[

Radically different than typical data storage, edge-lists include:
- **ego and an alter**
- tie strength or frequency
- edge attributes (time, event, text)

]


.pull-right[

```{r edge-list, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

student_edges <- read_excel("data/student-edgelist.xlsx")

student_edges |>
  head() |>
  kable()
```

]


]


.panel[.panel-name[Adjacency Matrix]

.pull-left[

Also radically different, an adjacency matrix includes:
- Column for each actor
- Row for each actor
- A Value indicate the presence/strength of a relation 

]


.pull-right[

```{r adjaency-matrix, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

teacher_matrix[1:9, 1:9]
```

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Take a look at one of the network datasets [here](https://github.com/laser-institute/network-analysis/tree/main/lab-1/data) and consider the following:

- What format is this data set stored as? 

- If edge data, is it directed or undirected? Valued?

- If node data, does the file contain attribute data? 

- What are some things you notice about this dataset? 

- What questions do you have about this dataset?

# Guiding Study

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Context]

.pull-left[

This longitudinal case study **examines reform-related knowledge, advice, and innovation network structures** among administrators in a district under sanction for under-performance and engaging in district-wide reform efforts.
]

.pull-right[

.center[<img src="img/daly-net.jpeg" height="320px"/>]
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Questions]

This study involves **quantifying and visualizing the ties and overall structure** of informal networks to answer the following research questions: 

1. In what ways have reform-related social networks between district and site leaders evolved **over a 2-year period**? 
2. How do district and school leaders perceive the evolution of the social networks and its **effect on the exchange of reform-related resources** within the district?
]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]
To answer RQ1, Daly and Finnigan administered **online survey consisting of network relations and demographic questions** asking participants to:
- select the administrators in the La Estasis network that they interact with for the purpose of **advise seeking, collaboration, confidential exchanges**,
- assess their relationships on a **5-point interaction scale** ranging from 1 (no interaction) to 5 (1 to 2 times a week).

]

.panel[.panel-name[Key Findings]

Ovearall, the findings from SNA and qualitative interviews indicate that over time: 
- Networks **increased the number of superficial interactions**.
- More frequent exchanges, however, remained unchanged. 
- The result was a centralized network structure.

# Load Packages

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Load Libraries]

Let's start by creating a new R script and loading the following packages introduced in the previous lab:          

```{r load-libraries, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(readxl)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[network packages 📦]

.pull-left[
.center[Network Management

<br>
[ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html)
]
]


]


.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]

Load the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} packages.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

```{r load-igraph, echo=TRUE}
# YOUR CODE HERE
#
#
```

]

]

# Import Data   

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Import Data]

Let's start by importing two Excel files that contain data about the nodes and the edges in our student friendship network:

```{r import-data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
student_nodes <- read_excel("lab-1/data/student-attributes.xlsx")

student_edges <- read_excel("lab-1/data/student-edgelist.xlsx")
```


```{r real-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
student_edges <- read_excel("data/student-edgelist.xlsx")

student_nodes <- read_excel("data/student-attributes.xlsx")
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Inspect Data]

Now let's take a look at the data file we just imported using the `View()` or other function of choice:

```{r inspect-data, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
View(student_edges)

View(student_nodes)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below and be prepared to share your response:              
1. What do you think the rows and columns in each file represent? 
1. What about the values in each cell represent?
1. What else do you notice about the data? 
1. What questions do you have?

# Tidy Graph  

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[tbl_graph( ) function]

The [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) function creates a special network data structure for "tidy graph" manipulation and combines nodes and edges into a single R object. 

Run the following code in your R script:

```{r wrangle-data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
student_network <- tbl_graph(edges = student_edges,
                             nodes = student_attributes, 
                             directed = TRUE) 
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[View Network]


Using your R script, type the name of network object we just created and run the code to produce the output on the next tab:

```{r view-netwok, echo=TRUE}
# ADD CODE BELOW
#
#

```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Output]


```{r, echo=FALSE}
student_network
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below:              

1. What is size of the student-reported friendship network?
1. What else do you notice about this network?
1. What questions do have about this network summary?

# A Simple Sociogram

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[plot( )]

.pull-left[ 
The `plot()` function is base R's simple but limited solution for plotting graphs.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
plot(student_network)
```

]

.center[
.pull-right[ 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
plot(student_network)
```
]
]
 
]


.panel[.panel-name[autograph( )]
.pull-left[ 
The `autograph()` function is ggraph's simple but limited solution for plotting sociograms.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
autograph(student_network)
```

]

.center[
.pull-right[ 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
autograph(student_network)
```
]
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Arguments]
.pull-left[ 
Both functions allow a small degree of customization, but are still limited.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
autograph(student_network,
          node_label = id,
          node_colour = gender)
```

]

.center[
.pull-right[ 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
autograph(student_network,
          node_label = id,
          node_colour = gender)
```
]
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]
1. In what situations might these limited functions be useful? 
2. When might they inapropriate to use?

]
]

# Sophisticated Sociograms

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Set Graph]

The `ggraph()` function is the first function required to build a sociogram. This function: 
1. takes care of setting up the plot object 
1. creates the layout based on specification provided.

Try running this function and see what happens:
```{r set-graph, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
ggraph(student_network)
```
]
 

.panel[.panel-name["Add" Nodes]

.pull-left[
Let's “add” nodes to our sociogram using the `+` operator and the `geom_node_point()` function:
```{r , echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
ggraph(student_network) + 
  geom_node_point() 
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '85%'}
ggraph(student_network) + 
  geom_node_point() 
```

How would you interpret this measure?
]
]


.panel[.panel-name[Add Edges]

.pull-left[
Now let's “add” edges to our sociogram using the `+` operator and the `geom_node_point()` function:
```{r , echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
ggraph(student_network) + 
  geom_node_point() + 
  geom_edge_link()
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '85%'}
ggraph(student_network) + 
  geom_node_point() + 
  geom_edge_link()
```

How would you interpret this measure?
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Polish]

.pull-left[
<br>
<br>
The {ggraph} packages allows for some fairly sophisticated graphs:
]

.pull-right[
.center[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width ='88%'}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .1) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph()
```
]
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]
With a fair bit of coding: 
```{r , echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .1) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph()
```
]
