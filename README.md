# Social Network Analysis in STEM Ed Research

Although social network analysis (SNA) and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, public and scholarly interest in social network analysis did not really take off until the turn of the century. Applications of social network analysis has experienced exponential growth, and across a wide range of phenomena, as documented by a number of studies. Despite educational research lagging behind other fields in it's application of SNA, an increase in the use of digital learning resources and data collected by these educational technologies, as well as improved access to training and tools for collecting and analyzing these data, has greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning.

## SNA Module 1: The Social Network Perspective & MOOC-Eds

Module 1 is designed to prepare LASER Institute scholars for collecting, processing, and analyzing relational data from a real-world study. Specifically, the three Learning Labs that make up this module address the following topics:

**Learning Lab 1: Attributes, Edge-Lists, & igraphs, Oh My!** In our first lab, we prepare for analysis by gaining some context about our data; learning how to wrangle network data structures; and examining network descriptives such as network size, node degree and edge weights.

**Learning Lab 2: Sociograms & Network Visualization.** For our second lab, we discuss the goals of network visualization and ways to explore relational data visually, including both static and dynamic network visualizations.

**Learning Lab 3: Cores, Cliques, & Communities.**Â We wrap up SNA Module 1 with a quick look at both "bottom-up" and "top-down" approaches to identifying groups within a network and why that might be of interest to researchers.
