# Social Network Analysis in STEM Ed Research

Although social network analysis (SNA) and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have raised awareness of, and renewed interests in, social networks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, data collected by these educational technologies has also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning. These introductory learning labs are designed to prepare STEM researchers and practitioners to apply network analysis in order to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. The presentations and case studies for each lab will provide scholars with an overview of social network theory, examples of network analysis in STEM educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques.

**SNA Learning Lab 1: Network Analysis for Newbies** is a gentle introduction to social network theory, analysis and applications in education. The focus of our presentation and case study in this lab is helping LASER Scholars gain a general understanding of key SNA concepts and measures, and develop a basic comfort level with representing networks visually. Our **SNA Case Study: Hashtag Common Core** is inspired by the work of Jonathan Supovitz, Alan Daly, Miguel del Fresno and Christian Kolouch who examined the intense Twitter debate surrounding the Common Core State Standards, as is detailed on their expansive and interactive website for the [#COMMONCORE Project](https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com/).

**SNA Learning Lab 4: Network Selection Processes** wraps up our work with SNA with a focus network selection and Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), which provide a way to determine whether network properties (e.g., reciprocity, homophily, popularity) occur more frequently than you could expect from chance alone. Our **SNA Case Study: School Leader Selection Mechanisms** is once again guided by the work of [Alan Daly](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zgbarXQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and colleagues, and revisits visual and mathematical descriptions of networks explored so far to help uncover and then empirically test processes that attempt to explain how district and school-level leaders select peers for collaboration or confidential exchanges.
