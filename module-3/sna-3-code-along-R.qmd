## Overview

1.  **Prepare**: Review the [#COMMONCORE](https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com) project including questions, data, and key findings.

2.  **Wrangle**: Revisit basic techniques for manipulating, cleaning, transforming, and merging network data.

3.  **Explore**: Calculate some key measures for individuals in our network and illustrate key actors through network visualization.

4.  **Model**: Introduce community detection algorithms for identifying groups.

5.  **Communicate**: Discuss website as a format for sharing findings.

Introduction to #COMMONCORE

## Guiding Study

::: panel-tabset
### Context

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
Our third SNA learning lab is inspired by the [#commoncore Project](https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com/), which examined the intense debate surrounding the Common Core State Standards education reform as it played out on Twitter.

### Questions

The central question guiding the #COMMONCORE Project was:

> How are social media-enabled social networks changing the discourse in American politics that produces and sustains education policy?

### Data

-   The authors used Twitter's (now X's, now sadly defunct) Application Programming Interface (API) based on tweets using specified keywords, keyphrases, or hashtags and then restricted their analysis to the following terms: commoncore, ccss and stopcommoncore.

-   They also captured Twitter profile names, or user names, as well as the tweets, retweets, and mentions posted.

### Findings

-   In Act 1, The Giant Network, the authors **identified five major sub-communities**, or factions, including: (1) supporters, (2) opponents inside education, and (3) opponents outside of education.

-   In Act 2, Central Actors, they noted that most of these participants were casual contributors and distinguished between two types of **central actors** on Twitter: Transmitters and Transceivers.

# Wrangle

Import, Inspect, and Tidy Network Data

## Inspect Data

::: panel-tabset
### Load Libraries

Let's start by creating a new R script and loading the following packages introduced in previous modules:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
```

```{r load-libraries, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)

# You may have to install this package if it is not listed in your packages pane.
# install.packages(tidyverse) 
```

### Import Data

Run the following code to use the `read_csv()` function from the {readr} package to read the `ccss-tweets-fresh.csv` file from the data folder and assign to a new data frame named `ccss_tweets`:

```{r}
ccss_ties <- read_csv("data/ccss-edgelist.csv")
ccss_nodes <- read_csv("data/ccss-nodelist.csv")
```

``` r
ccss_ties <- read_csv("module-1/data/ccss-edgelist.csv")
ccss_nodes <- read_csv("module-1/data/ccss-nodelist.csv")
```

### Inspect Data

Now let's take a look at the data file we just imported using the View() function or another function of choice you may have learned in the Foundations Labs:

<br>

``` r
view(ccss_ties)
view(ccss_nodes)
```

### Discuss

Think about the questions below and be prepared to share your response:

1.  What do you think the rows and columns in each file represent?

2.  What about the values in each cell represent?

3.  What else do you notice about the data?

4.  What questions do you have?
